The `cmpsR` package is an implementation of the Congruent Matching
Profile Segments (CMPS) method (Chen et al. 2019). In general, it can be
used for objective comparison of striated tool marks, but in our
examples, we mainly use it for bullet profiles/signatures comparison.
The CMPS number is expected to be large if two signatures are similar.
So it can also be considered as a feature that measures the similarity
of two bullets.

## Installation

You can install the released version of cmpsR from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cmpsR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("willju-wangqian/cmpsR")
```

## Example and Summary of the Algorithm

In this section we use a known match (KM) compasison to illustrate the
main ideas of CMPS algorithm. The bullet data used here can be found in
Chapter 3.5 of [Open Forensic Science in
R](https://sctyner.github.io/OpenForSciR/bullets.html#case-study-1).

We can also run the following chunk. In this example, we are taking the
signature of the third land engraved area (LEA) of the second bullet as
the reference signature and the second LEA of the first bullet as the
comparison signature. This is a KM comparison.

``` r
library(cmpsR)

data("bullets")
land23 <- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == "2-3"][[1]]
land12 <- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == "1-2"][[1]]

x <- land23$sig
y <- land12$sig

cmps <- extract_feature_cmps(x, y, full_result = TRUE)
cmps

# $CMPS.score
# [1] 14
# 
# $rec.position
# [1] -5
# 
# $pos.df
#   position cmps
# 1       -9   14
# 2       -8   14
# 3       -7   14
# 4       -6   14
# 5       -5   14
# 6       -4   14
# 7       -3   14
# 8       -2   14
# 9       -1   14
# 
# $nseg
# [1] 22
```

And we have the plot of `x` and `y`.

#### Main Idea

The main idea of the CMPS method is that:

1.  we take the first signature as the reference signature (`x`) and cut
    it into consecutive and non-overlapping basis segments of the same
    length. In this case, we set the length of a basis segment to be 50
    units, and we have 22 basis segments in total.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/step1_1.png" alt="Cut x into consecutive and non-overlapping basis segments of the same length. Only 4 basis segments are shown here" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Cut x into consecutive and non-overlapping basis segments of the same
length. Only 4 basis segments are shown here
</p>

</div>

2.  for each basis segment, we compute the cross-correlation function
    (ccf) between the basis segment and the comparison signature (`y`)

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/step2_1.png" alt="y and 7th basis segment" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
y and 7th basis segment
</p>

</div>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/step2_2.png" alt="the cross-correlation function (ccf) between y and segment 7" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>

</div>

-   for the `ccf` curve, the `position` represents the shift of the
    segment. A negative value means a shift to the left, a positive
    value means a shift to the right, and 0 means no shift (the segment
    stays at its original position in the reference signature);
-   we are interested in the peaks in the ccf curve and the positions of
    those peaks (as indicated by the red vertical line in the plot
    above). In other words, if we shift the segment, which position
    would give us the “best fit?”

3.  If two signatures are similar (a KM comparison), most of the basis
    segments should agree with each other on the position of the best
    fit. Then these segments are called the “**Congruent Matching
    Profile Segments**.”

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/step1_2.png" alt="compare y to the basis segments of x" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
compare y to the basis segments of x
</p>

</div>

And ideally, if two signatures are identical, we are expecting the
position of the highest peak in the ccf curve remains the same across
all ccf curves (we only show 7 segments here);

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/step3_1.png" alt="ideal case: compare x to itself. The highest peak has value 1 and is marked by the blue dot" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
ideal case: compare x to itself. The highest peak has value 1 and is
marked by the blue dot
</p>

</div>

But in the real case, the basis segments might not achieve a final
agreement, but we have the majority;

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/step3_2.png" alt="real case: compare x to y. The 5 highest peaks are marked by the blue dots" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
real case: compare x to y. The 5 highest peaks are marked by the blue
dots
</p>

</div>

We mark the 5 highest peaks for each ccf curve because the position of
the “highest peak” might not be the best one.

4.  each ccf curve votes for 5 candidate positions, then we ask two
    questions in order to obtain the CMPS number/score:

-   which position receives the most votes? -&gt; the best position
    (indicated by the red vertical line)

-   how many segments have voted for the best position? -&gt; CMPS
    number

    If we focus on these 7 segments only, and have a very short
    tolerance zone, the CMPS number is 6.

    (If we consider all 22 segments, and have a default tolerance zone
    (+/- 25 units), the CMPS number is 20.)

5.  false positive: how can the segments vote more wisely? -&gt; Multi
    Segment Lengths Strategy

-   by increasing the segment length (scale), one can reduce the number
    of “false positive” peaks

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/step5_1.png" alt="Multi Segment Lengths Strategy - increasing the segment length could decrease the number of false positive peaks in ccf curves" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">

</div>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="man/figures/step5_2.png" alt="Multi Segment Lengths Strategy - increasing the segment length could decrease the number of false positive peaks in ccf curves" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Multi Segment Lengths Strategy - increasing the segment length could

</p>

</div>

-   we choose 5 peaks at scale 1; 3 peaks at scale 2; 1 peak at scale 3

    the peak shared by all three scales is a **consistent correlation
    peak** (ccp). And the position of the ccp is our best choice.
    Sometimes a ccp might not be found. Trying to identify a ccp for
    each basis segment is called a “multi segment lengths” strategy.

-   and then, each ccf curve votes for only 1 best condidate position if
    a ccp can be found; again, we ask two quesitons:

    -   which position receives the most votes?
    -   how many segments have voted for this position? -&gt; CMPS
        number

-   by default, CMPS algorithm uses the multi-segment lengths strategy.

6.  if we consider all segments and use the multi-segment lengths
    strategy

-   when comparing x and y, a KM comparison, we have

``` r
extract_feature_cmps(x, y, seg_length = 50, seg_scale_max = 3, Tx = 25, 
                     npeaks.set = c(5, 3, 1), full_result = TRUE)

# $CMPS.score
# [1] 14
# 
# $rec.position
# [1] -5
# 
# $pos.df
#   position cmps
# 1       -9   14
# 2       -8   14
# 3       -7   14
# 4       -6   14
# 5       -5   14
# 6       -4   14
# 7       -3   14
# 8       -2   14
# 9       -1   14
# 
# $nseg
# [1] 22
```

-   if we have a KNM (known non-match) comparison, e.g. compare land 2-3
    with land 1-3:

``` r
land23 <- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == "2-3"][[1]]
land13 <- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == "1-3"][[1]]

result <- extract_feature_cmps(land23$sig, land13$sig, seg_length = 50, seg_scale_max = 3, Tx = 25, 
                     npeaks.set = c(5, 3, 1), full_result = TRUE)
result$CMPS.score
# [1] 1

result$rec.position
# [1] 128

result$nseg
# [1] 22
```

#### Full Comparison Between Two Bullets

`extract_feature_cmps()` can also be used in a pipeline fashion

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(bulletxtrctr)

lands <- unique(bullets$bulletland)

                        .f = function(xx, yy) {
                          land1 <- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == xx][[1]]
                          land2 <- bullets$sigs[bullets$bulletland == yy][[1]]
                          land1$bullet <- "first-land"

                        }))

## Future Work

-   improve and manage to submit the cmpsR package to CRAN

-   cross-validate some hyper-parameters

-   apply CMPS to

    -   the dataset used in the paper to see if we can reproduce their
        results
    -   other datasets
