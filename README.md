# CMPS

- `demo_get_ccf.Rmd` is a demo that compares `get_ccf()`, `get_ccf2()`, and `get_ccf3()`. And my suggestion on how we can modify and use `get_ccf()`

- `func_collection.R` has all functions I currently have

- `current_working.R` has codes that I'm working with right now, including `findpeaks()` and `sig_get_peaks()`

- `CMPS_basic.R` has codes that I started with, but it's not important at this point.
