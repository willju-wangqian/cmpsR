Description: The cmpsR package is an open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching 
    Profile Segments (CMPS) method (Chen et al. 2019). In general, it can be used for 
    objective comparison of striated tool marks, and in our examples, we specifically use  
    it for bullet signatures comparisons. The CMPS score is expected to be large if two 
    signatures are similar. So it can also be considered as a feature that measures the 
    similarity of two bullet signatures.
