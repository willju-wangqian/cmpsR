Description: The CMPS package is an implementation of the Congruent Matching 
    Profile Segments (CMPS) method (Chen et al. 2019). In general, it can be used for 
    objective comparison of striated tool marks, but in our examples, we mainly 
    use it for bullet profiles/signatures comparison. The CMPS number is 
    expected to be large if two signatures are similar. So it can also be 
    considered as a feature that measures the similarity of two bullets.
